# VAE-Surv: Variational Autoencoder for Survival Analysis

## Introduction

**VAE-Surv** integrates a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** with a **survival prediction model** to identify patient subgroups and predict survival outcomes. Originally developed for **Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)** patients, it can be applied to various biomedical datasets. The VAE reduces high-dimensional molecular data to a **latent space**, which is then used alongside clinical features in a **Cox neural network** for survival analysis.

### Key Features:
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Extracts a meaningful latent representation from high-dimensional genomic data.
- **Survival Prediction**: Uses a deep Cox network to model survival risk.
- **Patient Clustering**: Performs unsupervised clustering in the latent space to identify distinct prognostic groups.
- **Joint Training**: Optimizes both reconstruction (VAE) and survival loss to enhance predictive performance.

The repository includes an example on the **METABRIC breast cancer dataset**, but the model is designed to work with any structured biomedical dataset containing molecular and clinical features.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/VAE-Surv.git  
   cd VAE-Surv
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **(Optional) Run Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

VAE-Surv requires a dataset with clinical features, high-dimensional molecular/genomic data, and survival outcomes.

### Basic workflow:
1. **Preprocessing**: Structure the dataset into:
    - `X`: Feature matrix (clinical + high-dimensional features).
    - `y`: Survival labels (`time` and `event`).
    - `mask`: Boolean array indicating which features go into the VAE.

2. **Initialize and train model:**
   ```bash
    from VAE_surv import VAESurv
    model = VAESurv(**config)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)
   ```

3. **Evaluate performance**:
    ```bash
     c_index = model.score(X_test, y_test)
     print(f"C-index on Test: {c_index:.3f}")
    ```
4. **Latent Space Representation & Clustering**:
   ```bash
    latent_features = model.transform(X)
    cluster_labels = kmeans_clustering(latent_features, k=8)
    ```
5. **Visualization & Survival Analysis**:

   - t-SNE plots of latent space (`plot_latent_rep()`)
   - Kaplanâ€“Meier survival curves for clusters (`plot_tsne_and_survival()`)
